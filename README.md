## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository for **ROB 144: Machine Learning for Robotics**, a course offered through **WSU Tech's Robotics Program**. This repository contains my labs and final project, developed as part of the coursework during the Spring 2025 semester. The focus of this class is to explore machine learning techniques applied to robotics, leveraging tools like **Python** and **PyTorch** to build and train models for robotic systems.

This repo serves as a record of my progress, showcasing practical implementations of machine learning concepts in robotics, including data processing, neural networks, and more. Whether you're a fellow student, instructor, or robotics enthusiast, I hope you find something useful here!

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for all implementations.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
- Additional libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) may be used as needed—check each lab or project for specific dependencies.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you’ll need:
1. **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **PyTorch**: Install via pip or conda (see [PyTorch’s official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for instructions).
3. Other dependencies: Refer to individual lab/project READMEs or `requirements.txt` files (if included) for additional setup.
